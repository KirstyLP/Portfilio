            <h2>Kirsty Poxon</h2>
            <P>I've always been hardworking, due to my past. I always wanted to be the best and to prove myself, so I always kept busy and learn as many skills as possible and most of the skills I learn do help me in the field; I plan on working on but it wasn't always what I wanted to be. From a young age, I wanted to be game designer as I loved games and puzzles and when I saw my brother play them and see the joy he got by playing. I wanted to do the same for others. I also wanted to be an influencer as most kids did as the youtube era became popular, however, I realised that goal was unrealistic as I dont't do well when there is an audience but it a weakness I working on improving.</P>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am working with Netmatters to improve my skills. You can find different projects I have made in my portfilio. However, I am also working on my art skills as I find drawing relaxs me when I am not working; Drawing and Video games are my relax time and helps me keep sane. Some of my games I regular play are Minecraft, Dragon Age: Inquistion and Outward. I don't just love games but I love binge watching shows espically if it is fantasy based; some of my favourite shows are Supernatural, The Orginals and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I'm currently watching Blacklist. I don't just rely on technology for my entaintment as I love going on walks and reading in nice areas to remove myself from the tech world as it can be overwhelming at times. Some of favourite books are; Seven Soucerers, Skulduggery Pleasant and Harry Potter(Movies don't do them justice).</p>
            <br>
            <p>As I grew up, my goals also changed and now hoping to work in the field of development. That why I was I happy to join the Scion Scheme in which they help focus my skills and help me learn the skills to achieve my goal. My goals is hopefully get a job as a software developer the make me enough that I can live comfortable. I am also hoping that field I go into will hopefully include A.I as I love technology. However, I mostly care about a good enviorment and making enough that I can support not just myself but my family. Where I see myself in 5 years? I hoping to be fully employ in a full time job, I get myself a place in which is not share accomandation and that my son can call home. </p>
